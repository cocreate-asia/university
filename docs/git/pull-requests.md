    - Example: ```feat: Proivdes functionality abc on merge``` .

* Write summary as paragraphs or bullet points also works.

* For code which generates visual output on compile, attach screenshots of the output.

* For code which generates api calls, attach link / screenshot of request and response of the data.

* If test cases are being written, attach test cases success screenshot as well.
